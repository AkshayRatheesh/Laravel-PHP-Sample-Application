The Laravel-PHP-Sample-Application is a simple and straightforward application that demonstrates the use of the Laravel framework. It contains a basic template and a few routes to help get you started. 

The application also includes a few basic features such as authentication, registration, and a home page.

To run the application, you will need to have the following installed:

- PHP 7 or higher

Once all the requirements are installed, you can clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the application.

To get started, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/username/laravel-php-sample-application.git` <br>
`cd laravel-php-sample-application` <br>
`composer install`

The application is now ready to run.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
